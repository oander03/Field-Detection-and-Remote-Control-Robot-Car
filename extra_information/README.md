# Field Detection and Wire-Following Firmware

This folder contains the standalone firmware target for magnetic-wire field
detection, wire following, and obstacle stopping on the robot.

For a higher-level overview of how the firmware is structured, see
`SOFTWARE_ARCHITECTURE.md`.

It now also includes a standalone bare-metal STM32L051 firmware target for
wire-following bring-up:

- `main.c`: top-level auto-mode firmware loop
- `board.c`: STM32L051 bare-metal PWM/ADC bring-up plus a thin HAL-style shim
- `auto_mode.mk`: CrossIDE-style makefile that builds `auto_mode.elf/.hex`

The software assumes:

- two field detectors are used for left/right tracking
- one field detector is used for intersection detection
- all three detector outputs go to ADC inputs
- one VL53L0X sensor is used for front collision detection
- each motor is controlled through an H-bridge

The initial goal is to:

1. Read the three detector voltages through the ADC.
2. Keep the robot centered over the guide wire.
3. Detect intersections.
4. Choose the next action from the selected path and the number of times an intersection has been met.
5. Stop the robot if the collision detector reports an obstacle.
6. Drive the motors according to the wire-following state machine.

Suggested module split for the full firmware:

- `board.c`: clocks, GPIO, timer, ADC, I2C init
- `field_sensor_adc_config.h`: editable ADC pin and channel mapping
- `field_sensor_adc.c`: STM32 HAL ADC reads for the 3 field sensors
- `collision_detector.c`: VL53L0X collision readout and stop override support
- `hbridge_motor.c`: signed motor command to GPIO/PWM mapping
- `field_sensor.c`: ADC reads and filtering for left/right/intersection
- `robot_auto_mode.c`: state machine and steering logic
- `path_manager.c`: path selection and intersection-count lookup
- `remote_control.c`: remote command handling

Recommended control-loop flow:

1. Update field sensors.
2. Update the collision detector.
3. If obstacle detected, stop the motors.
4. Otherwise check for signal-loss conditions and intersections.
5. Run one state-machine step.
6. Apply signed motor outputs to the H-bridges.

Current starter states:

- `ROBOT_AUTO_FOLLOW`
- `ROBOT_AUTO_INTERSECTION`
- `ROBOT_AUTO_STOP`
- `ROBOT_AUTO_LOST`

Current starter abstractions:

- `main.c` is the standalone firmware entry point for magnetic-wire following tests
- `board.c` owns the STM32L051 timer/ADC setup used by the standalone target
- `field_sensor_adc_config.h` is where you change ADC pins and channels
- `field_sensor_adc_config.h` also holds placeholder detector thresholds that should be retuned when your analog amplifier gain changes
- `field_sensor_adc_update(...)` reads the 3 ADC channels with simple oversampling and updates filtering
- `collision_detector_update(...)` reads the VL53L0X in continuous mode and raises an obstacle flag
- `field_sensor_update(...)` turns three ADC samples into filtered signal, baseline, and field-detected flags
- `hbridge_motor_apply(...)` is the motor integration point
- `PA7` is reserved for the collision sensor control line
- `hbridge_motor_config.h` is where you change the STM32 PWM timer/channel mapping
- `hbridge_motor_init()` starts the four PWM outputs used by the two H-bridges
- `path_context_t` tracks the selected path and how many intersections have been crossed

Important behavior:

- The path action is chosen when a new intersection starts.
- The code does not count the same intersection multiple times while the robot is still physically over it.
- Each field sensor now keeps a slow-moving baseline and hysteresis so guide-wire detection is less sensitive to ADC drift.
- The standalone target defaults to `PATH_ID_1` and runs the control loop every 10 ms after a short sensor warm-up.
- `field_sensor_adc.c` uses placeholder STM32 HAL constants and may need small family-specific tweaks before it compiles in your real project.

Default standalone wiring placeholders:

- Motor PWM: `PA0..PA3` on `TIM2_CH1..CH4`
- Left tracker ADC: `PA4` / `ADC_IN4`
- Right tracker ADC: `PA5` / `ADC_IN5`
- Intersection ADC: `PA6` / `ADC_IN6`
- Collision sensor control: `PA7`
- VL53L0X I2C: `PB6` / `PB7`

Build the standalone target:

```sh
cd auto_mode
make -f auto_mode.mk
```

Minimal motor bring-up:

```c
#include "hbridge_motor.h"

int main(void)
{
    HAL_Init();
    SystemClock_Config();
    MX_GPIO_Init();
    MX_TIM2_Init(); /* Replace with your actual PWM timer init. */

    hbridge_motor_init();

    while (1)
    {
        motor_command_t forward = { 600, 600 };
        hbridge_motor_apply(&forward);
    }
}
```

Before using the example above:

1. Configure four PWM outputs in CubeMX.
2. Update `hbridge_motor_config.h` to match your timer/channel names.
3. Set the PWM period so a command of `1000` is full speed.
