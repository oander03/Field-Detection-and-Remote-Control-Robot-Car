# Auto Mode Software Architecture

This document describes the standalone `auto_mode` firmware target used to test
magnetic-wire following and collision stopping on the STM32L051 robot.

## Purpose

The `auto_mode` folder is a self-contained firmware slice for one specific job:

- read three field-detector voltages
- follow the magnetic guide wire using the left/right detector pair
- detect intersections using the third detector
- monitor the front collision sensor
- stop the robot when an obstacle is detected
- choose actions from a preconfigured path table
- drive the two motors through the H-bridge PWM outputs

It is not yet the full project firmware for the entire robot. Remote-control
firmware and other robot subsystems live outside this target. This folder is
specifically the field-detection and wire-following slice.

## Layered Structure

The code is organized in layers from low-level hardware access up to behavior:

```text
main.c
  -> board_init()
  -> field_sensor_adc_update()
  -> collision_detector_update()
  -> robot_auto_mode_step() or hbridge_motor_stop_all()
  -> hbridge_motor_apply() through the selected control path

board.c / main.h
  -> STM32L051 register setup
  -> timer PWM
  -> ADC
  -> SysTick delay

field_sensor_adc.c / field_sensor_adc_config.h
  -> sensor GPIO setup
  -> ADC channel selection
  -> oversampled sensor reads

collision_detector.c / collision_detector_config.h
  -> PA7 collision-sensor control
  -> PB6/PB7 I2C setup for VL53L0X
  -> continuous range measurement
  -> obstacle stop decision

robot_auto_mode.c / robot_auto_mode.h
  -> field signal filtering
  -> baseline tracking
  -> follow / intersection / lost / stop state machine
  -> path table lookup

  -> signed motor commands
  -> PWM compare outputs for H-bridge inputs
```

## Runtime Control Flow

At startup:

1. `main()` calls `board_init()`.
2. `field_sensor_adc_init()` configures sensor pins.
3. `hbridge_motor_init()` prepares PWM outputs.
4. `field_sensor_reset()` clears sensor state.
5. `collision_detector_init()` brings up the VL53L0X.
6. A short warm-up loop lets the detector filters and baselines settle.
7. `robot_auto_mode_init()` selects the initial path and resets path state.

During each loop iteration:

1. `field_sensor_adc_update(&sensors)`
   - reads left, right, and intersection detector voltages
   - applies oversampling
   - updates filtered and baseline-compensated sensor state

2. `collision_detector_update(&collision)`
   - checks whether a new VL53L0X measurement is ready
   - reads distance when available
   - updates the obstacle-detected flag

3. Obstacle arbitration in `main.c`
   - if an obstacle is detected, call `hbridge_motor_stop_all()`
   - otherwise run the normal auto-mode state machine

4. `robot_auto_mode_step(&sensors, &path_context)`
   - checks wire presence
   - checks intersection state
   - runs follow logic or path action logic
   - computes signed motor commands

5. `hbridge_motor_apply(...)`
   - updates TIM2 PWM compare values for the H-bridge

6. `delayms(10)`
   - enforces the loop period

## Sensor Interpretation Model

The firmware treats the three field detectors as:

- left tracker
- right tracker
- intersection detector

The left and right detectors are used as a pair:

- if left signal is stronger than right, steer to reduce the error
- if right signal is stronger than left, steer the other way
- if they are close, drive straight

This implements the project goal of keeping the robot centered over the guide
wire by trying to keep the two detector responses balanced.

The intersection detector is handled separately:

- it does not steer the robot during normal follow mode
- it indicates that a new route decision point has been reached

## Preconfigured Paths

The route is not discovered from the ADC values alone.  The route is chosen
from a predefined table in `robot_auto_mode.c`.

Sensor data only tells the firmware:

- where the wire is relative to the robot
- whether an intersection is currently present

The selected path table then tells the robot what to do at each new
intersection:

- straight
- left
- right
- stop

## Default Placeholder Hardware Mapping

The standalone target currently assumes:

- motor PWM outputs:
  - `PA0` -> TIM2_CH1
  - `PA1` -> TIM2_CH2
  - `PA2` -> TIM2_CH3
  - `PA3` -> TIM2_CH4

- field detector ADC inputs:
  - left tracker -> `PA4` -> ADC_IN4
  - right tracker -> `PA5` -> ADC_IN5
  - intersection detector -> `PA6` -> ADC_IN6

- collision detector:
  - `PA7` -> VL53L0X control pin
  - `PB6` -> I2C1 SCL
  - `PB7` -> I2C1 SDA

The field detector thresholds are still placeholder tuning values and should be
retuned to match the real analog front-end gain.

## Build and Run

Build the firmware:

```sh
cd auto_mode
make -f auto_mode.mk
```

Clean build outputs:

```sh
make -f auto_mode.mk clean
```

The generated files are:

- `auto_mode.elf`
- `auto_mode.hex`

## Design Notes

- The hardware setup in `board.c` is based on the STM32L051 course reference
  code, especially the ADC and timer examples.
- The sensor thresholds are intentionally placeholders because the real values
  depend on detector gain, geometry, and analog front-end behavior.
- The collision detector currently acts as a top-level stop override in
  `main.c`, which keeps the wire-following state machine unchanged and makes
  obstacle integration easy to test on hardware.
- The code is split into small modules so a future full robot firmware can
  reuse the same sensor, control, and motor layers under a larger top-level
  application.
